- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD for automatic deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Supabase account (for database and authentication)

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the database schema setup script from the `schema.sql` file in the SQL editor
3. Configure authentication providers as needed
4. Get your Supabase URL and anonymous key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ShiroLuxferre/KonBase.git
   cd konbase
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create an `.env` file with your Supabase credentials
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Build for production
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

### GitHub Pages Deployment

To deploy to GitHub Pages:

1. Configure GitHub repository settings:
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Set source to GitHub Actions

2. Set up repository secrets:
   - SUPABASE_URL: Your Supabase project URL
   - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Your Supabase anonymous key

3. Push changes to the main branch to trigger automatic deployment

## Connecting to Supabase

This project uses Supabase as its backend. To connect your local development environment to your remote Supabase project, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Supabase CLI:**
    If you haven't already, install the Supabase CLI. Follow the official instructions for your operating system: [Supabase CLI Installation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started#installation)

2.  **Log in to Supabase:**
    Open your terminal (Powershell in your case) and log in to your Supabase account:
    ```powershell
    supabase login
    ```
    This will open a browser window for authentication.

3.  **Link your Project:**
    Navigate to the root directory of this project (`konbase-open-source`) in your terminal and link it to your remote Supabase project:
    ```powershell
    supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` with your actual Supabase project reference ID. You can find this in your Supabase project's dashboard URL (e.g., `https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT_REF`) or in Project Settings -> General.

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The application needs your Supabase Project URL and Anon Key to communicate with the backend.
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project if it doesn't exist.
    *   Add the following lines to the `.env` file:

        ```dotenv
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
        ```
    *   Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL` and `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with the actual values from your Supabase project dashboard (Project Settings -> API).

5.  **(Optional) Pull Remote Database Changes:**
    If you have made changes to your remote database schema *after* linking, you might want to pull those changes to keep your local `supabase/migrations` folder in sync (though this project currently uses `schema.sql` for initial setup):
    ```powershell
    supabase db pull
    ```
    *Note: Be cautious with this command if you have local migration files you haven't applied remotely.*

6.  **Run the Application:**
    You should now be able to run the application locally, and it will connect to your remote Supabase instance.
    ```powershell
    npm run dev
    ```

## Database Setup (Manual)

Since the first-time setup wizard has been removed, follow these steps to set up your Supabase database manually:

1.  Navigate to your Supabase project dashboard.
2.  Go to the **SQL Editor**.
3.  Click **"New query"**.
4.  Copy the entire content of the `schema.sql` file from this project.
5.  Paste the content into the SQL Editor.
6.  Run the query. This will create all necessary tables, roles, functions, and RLS policies.
7.  **Grant Super Admin:**
    *   Sign up a user for your application (this will be your super admin).
    *   Find the `user_id` (UUID) of this user in the Supabase Dashboard under Authentication -> Users.
    *   Open the `super_admin.sql` file in this project.
    *   Replace the placeholder `'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE'` with the actual `user_id`.
    *   Go back to the Supabase **SQL Editor** and create another **"New query"**.
    *   Copy the modified content of `super_admin.sql` and paste it into the editor.
    *   Run the query.

Your database is now set up and connected to the application.
