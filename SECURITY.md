# Security Policy

## Overview

The KonBase Convention Management System prioritizes security to protect user data, inventory records, and organizational information. This document outlines our approach to security and provides guidance for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within KonBase, please:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Email details to [security@konbase.com](mailto:security@konbase.com)
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. If possible, provide suggestions for resolving the issue

We strive to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and will work to address verified vulnerabilities promptly. We appreciate your assistance in keeping KonBase secure.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Methods
- Email/password with strong password requirements
- OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft)
