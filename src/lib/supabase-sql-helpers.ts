 * Helper file containing SQL snippets that were used to resolve infinite recursion in RLS policies
 * 
 * The following SQL has been applied to fix the infinite recursion error:
 * 
 * ```sql
 * -- First, create a security definer function to check association membership
 * CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_member_of_association(user_id UUID, assoc_id UUID)
 * RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
 * BEGIN
 *   -- Direct query avoids the RLS check that causes recursion
 *   RETURN EXISTS (
 *     SELECT 1 FROM association_members
 *     WHERE user_id = $1 AND association_id = $2
 *   );
 * EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
 *   -- Log error and return false as fallback
 *   RAISE LOG 'Error in is_member_of_association: %', SQLERRM;
 *   RETURN false;
 * END;
 * $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
 * 
 * -- Updated policies for association_members
 * DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can manage all memberships" ON association_members;
 * CREATE POLICY "Admin users can manage all memberships"
 *   ON association_members
 *   USING ((SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) IN ('admin', 'super_admin'));
 * 
 * -- Update policies on associations table
 * DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view associations they are members of" ON associations;
 * CREATE POLICY "Users can view associations they are members of"
 *   ON associations
 *   FOR SELECT
 *   USING (
 *     public.is_member_of_association(auth.uid(), id)
 *     OR
 *     (SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
 *   );
 * ```
 * 
 * The following SQL has been applied to enable convention access management:
 * 
 * ```sql
 * -- Create a security definer function to safely check convention access
 * CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.has_convention_access(user_id UUID, conv_id UUID)
 * RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
 * DECLARE
 *   user_role TEXT;
 *   is_member BOOLEAN;
 * BEGIN
 *   -- Get user's role
 *   SELECT role INTO user_role FROM profiles WHERE id = user_id;
 *   
 *   -- Check if user is associated with the convention's association
 *   SELECT EXISTS (
 *     SELECT 1 
 *     FROM conventions c
 *     JOIN association_members am ON c.association_id = am.association_id
 *     WHERE c.id = conv_id AND am.user_id = user_id
 *   ) INTO is_member;
 *   
 *   -- Return true if user is admin, super_admin, manager, or has direct access
 *   RETURN user_role IN ('admin', 'super_admin', 'manager', 'helper') 
 *          OR is_member
 *          OR EXISTS (
 *            SELECT 1 FROM convention_access 
 *            WHERE convention_id = conv_id AND user_id = user_id
 *          );
 *   EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
 *     RAISE LOG 'Error in has_convention_access: %', SQLERRM;
 *     RETURN false;
 * END;
 * $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
 * 
 * -- Update convention access policies
 * CREATE POLICY "Users can view conventions they have access to"
 *   ON conventions
 *   FOR SELECT
 *   USING (public.has_convention_access(auth.uid(), id));
 * 
 * -- Helper-specific access policy
 * CREATE POLICY "Helpers can access conventions they are invited to" 
 *   ON conventions 
 *   FOR SELECT 
 *   USING (
 *     EXISTS (
 *       SELECT 1 FROM convention_access
 *       WHERE convention_id = id AND user_id = auth.uid()
 *     )
 *   );
 * ```
 * 
 * -- To fix the infinite recursion in the profiles table RLS policies, we need to modify them:
 * 
 * ```sql
 * -- Drop the existing problematic policies on profiles
 * DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
 * DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
 * DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON profiles;
 * DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update all profiles" ON profiles;
 * 
 * -- Create a security definer function to safely check user role
 * CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_user_role(user_id UUID)
 * RETURNS TEXT AS $$
 * DECLARE
 *   user_role TEXT;
 * BEGIN
 *   -- Direct query to avoid RLS
 *   SELECT role INTO user_role FROM profiles WHERE id = user_id;
 *   RETURN user_role;
 * EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
 *   RETURN 'guest';
 * END;
 * $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
 * 
 * -- Create updated policies using the security definer function
 * CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
 *   ON profiles FOR SELECT
 *   USING (auth.uid() = id);
