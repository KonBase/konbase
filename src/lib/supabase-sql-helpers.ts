 * Helper file containing SQL snippets to resolve infinite recursion in RLS policies
 * 
 * To fix the infinite recursion error, run this SQL in the Supabase SQL editor:
 * 
 * ```sql
 * -- First, create a security definer function to check association membership
 * CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_member_of_association(user_id UUID, assoc_id UUID)
 * RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
 * BEGIN
 *   RETURN EXISTS (
 *     SELECT 1 FROM association_members
 *     WHERE user_id = $1 AND association_id = $2
 *   );
 * END;
 * $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
 * 
 * -- Then update the RLS policies on association_members table
 * DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Members can view their own associations" ON association_members;
 * CREATE POLICY "Members can view their own associations" 
 *   ON association_members 
 *   FOR SELECT 
 *   USING (user_id = auth.uid());
 * 
 * DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can manage all associations" ON association_members;
 * CREATE POLICY "Admin users can manage all associations"
 *   ON association_members
 *   USING ((SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) IN ('admin', 'super_admin'));
 * ```
