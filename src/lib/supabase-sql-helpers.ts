/**
 * Helper file containing SQL snippets that were used to resolve infinite recursion in RLS policies
 * 
 * The following SQL has been applied to fix the infinite recursion error:
 * 
 * ```sql
 * -- First, create a security definer function to check association membership
 * CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_member_of_association(user_id UUID, assoc_id UUID)
 * RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
 * BEGIN
 *   -- Direct query avoids the RLS check that causes recursion
 *   RETURN EXISTS (
 *     SELECT 1 FROM association_members
 *     WHERE user_id = $1 AND association_id = $2
 *   );
 * EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
 *   -- Log error and return false as fallback
 *   RAISE LOG 'Error in is_member_of_association: %', SQLERRM;
 *   RETURN false;
 * END;
 * $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
 * 
 * -- Updated policies for association_members
 * DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can manage all memberships" ON association_members;
 * CREATE POLICY "Admin users can manage all memberships"
 *   ON association_members
 *   USING ((SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) IN ('admin', 'super_admin'));
 * 
 * -- Update policies on associations table
 * DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view associations they are members of" ON associations;
 * CREATE POLICY "Users can view associations they are members of"
 *   ON associations
 *   FOR SELECT
 *   USING (
 *     public.is_member_of_association(auth.uid(), id)
 *     OR
 *     (SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
 *   );
 * ```
